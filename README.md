Task Overview

Diabetes is one of the most challenging chronic diseases that has a compounding factor on the general well-being of individuals.
In most cases, the disease can be averted if the risk is accurately outlined well in advance,
and healthy lifestyle changes are made. You have to create a classification model from the set of methods
we studied during the course, that can predict if someone will develop diabetes over the next 5 years.

Problem Scenario
You are provided a data set of 678 individuals, with information on Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure,
Skin Thickness, Insulin BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function and Age – along with the final outcome of whether
or not they had diabetes. You will develop an effective model that you believe is the best one for the given
classification task. You will need to compare your recommended model with others, given some convincing
metrics – for why your recommendation should be accepted. You can tweak parameters, add or remove
modules from your classification architecture/python code, find new techniques by searching online and bits
of efficient code.

Specifications
a well-commented code to show results, and explain them in the form of confusion
matric, sensitivity and specificity. You will need to explain your parameters and “metadata”, when explaining
your solution to the problem. You DO NOT have to explain the method (i.e. maths, theory etc.) that you use.

Output
A written report explaining your solution, the outcomes, parameters
Implementing a well-commented, accurate classification method to solve the problem
